# Implement mTLS
when you enable mutual TLS in mutual-tls.yamlm above, where someone can only talk to the service If they have the ``certificate``.

by default Istion runs a mutual TLS in the permissive mode, the permissive mode says you can either access the service using mutual TLS or you can also access it without mutual TLS
